If you have downloaded the source, see BUILD for information on how to build and
run the code.  If you downloaded the binary version, use these commands to get started:
        Unix: ./bin/galago help
        Windows: .\bin\galago.bat help

The main Java projects are:
	galagosearch-core:  The Galago structured search engine code
	galagosearch-tupleflow:  TupleFlow, Galago's distributed computation framework
	galagosearch-tupleflow-typebuilder:  TypeBuilder, a code generator for producing
             serializable, hashable and comparable types that TupleFlow can use

Code that's not yet distributed, but might be eventually:
	Java:
        galagosearch-binned:  Classes and code used for building binned indexes.
        galagosearch-tupleflow-gridengine:  Code that plugs TupleFlow into Grid Engine.

	C++:
	galago: A command-line retrieval system for binned indexes
	galagod: A FastCGI application for binned indexes
